# Outlook-for-Mac-Inline-Reply
This small project contains an AppleScript that people can use to do quoted inline plaintext replies in Outlook for Mac.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been possible to do this in Outlook for Mac since they switched their editing back end to Word at version 15.22.  This AppleScript give a way to do this.
